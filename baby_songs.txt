Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playin'
We're just friends, what are you sayin'
Said there's another, look right in my eyes
My first love, broke my heart for the first time

And I was like baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool
But I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me, 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She know she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Now I'm all gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Now I'm all gone)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Now I'm all gone)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Now I'm all gone)
Gone, gone, gone I'm gone gone

I really can't stay (but baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (but baby, it's cold outside)

This evening has been (been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)

So really I'd better scurry (beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (no cabs to be had out there)

I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (i'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)

I really can't stay (oh baby don't hold out)
But baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (but baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (but baby, it's cold outside)

Your welcome has been (how lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (look out the window at this dawn)

My sister will be suspicious (gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore)

My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)

I've gotta get home(but baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat(it's up to your knees out there)

You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (how can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (if you got pnuemonia and died)

I really can't stay (get over that old out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside

Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I startedagain
Trying to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart
Is there nothing left for me?
Is there nothing left for me?

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
I was wrong, and I just can't live

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
Baby come back

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, baby, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Ah, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

They knew all along
They're not dumb, they were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now, call when I'm done

Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target

Crazy TV dreams might be true
Not what it seems.
Food and cavities, chewing words
Tear at the seams
He don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that he should
I don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that I should

Did you ever listen?
Get out

If it gets you down well then I'll take it
If it gets you up well I don't want it
It let you down so broken-hearted
If it gets you down well then I want it

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
We're nothing at all

So blow our mind and make it lazy
Those long, long days with no escaping
I hold the wheel to let it go
Don't want to stop, don't want to know
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
We're nothing at all

Walkin' around in a daze, out for days now it?s been
Talkin' it up as amazin', a maze that I'm in
Look at lonely stars for the answers
But all that I found was silence and dirty ground

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

Listen just a little bit harder for I always tell the truth
Is it just a piston in an engine that keep you movin'
You're lookin' like you're lookin' for somethin'
And now you're surrounded by silence

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

In silence, silence, silence
You're surrounded by silence, silence, silence
Yes, you're surrounded by silence, silence, silence
You're surrounded by silence, silence

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

If only you could see me now
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only you could hear me out
(If only, if only, if only, if only, if)
If only it was only me now

If only it was only me now
If only it was only me now

I was just doing my thing hanging out at the spot
You know the place we go The music's John blaze hot
and everybody was feeling the DJ
The smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights were low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
The girl was fine, and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say

[Chorus]
She took my hand and never said a word at all
she starting grinding shorty had me up against the wall 
I see you bouncing now you know that I don't care at all 
she took me hand now she had me up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all

It's almost two o'clock, it's time to make my move 
The after-hour spot is where I'm going to
'cause I gotta have some more, looking for 
Somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eying me
The lights are low, and her friends are all around
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
She turned around, and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say

[Chorus: x3]

You know we don't care at all now let, let me see ya up, up against the wall
